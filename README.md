**1.HTML Setup:**

- Create a new HTML file.
- Set up the basic structure of an HTML document with the `declaration`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- Add a title to the document, such as "Color Changer".

**2.Create the Interface:**

- Inside the body tag, create a `<div>` element with a class name of "container".
- Inside the container, add an `<h1>` element with the text "Color Changer".
- Create another <div> element with an id of "color-box". This will represent the box whose color will change.
- Add a <button> element with an id of "change-color-btn". The button should have the text "Change Color".

**3.Styling with CSS:**

- Create a CSS file and link it to your HTML document using the `<link>` tag.
- Style the container class to center its content horizontally and give it some top margin for spacing.
- Style the color-box id with a fixed width and height, and set a default background color.
- Style the change-color-btn id to make it visually appealing and easily clickable.

**4.JavaScript for Interactivity:**

- Create a JavaScript file and link it to your HTML document using the `<script>` tag.
- Write JavaScript code to wait for the DOM content to be loaded using DOMContentLoaded event.
- Inside the event handler, select the color-box and change-color-btn elements using document.getElementById().
- Implement a function, let's call it getRandomColor(), which generates a random color. You may use hexadecimal or RGB values.
- Add an event listener to the change-color-btn element. When clicked, the event listener should trigger a function that changes the background color of the color-box to a random color generated by the getRandomColor() function.

**5.Testing:**

- Open your HTML file in a web browser.
- Click the "Change Color" button and observe the color of the box change dynamically.

### 6. Additional Feature:
- I've added a "Reset" button that reverts the box to its default color.
